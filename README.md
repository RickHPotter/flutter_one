## What is Flutter

<p>In the simplest terms, Flutter is a software development toolkit from Google for building
cross-platform apps. Flutter apps consist of a series of packages, plugins and widgets - but that's
not all. Flutter is a process, a philosophy and a community as well.</p>

Flutter ->
- [x] is *Open-Source*.
- [x] uses *Dart* programming language, a modern C-style, UI-focused language.
- [x] has *Hot Reload*, which allows you to make updates to the code that reflect without recompiling.
- [x] has *Material Design* natively.
- [x] has *composable* widgets, giving you room for creativity.
- [x] has *Platform Integration*, making it possible to to support Kotlin, Java, o-C and Swift code.

# Flutter Structure

<p>Class defines the Type of an Object, as we learned in Dart.</p>
<p>In the same way, in Flutter, every Widget, or Class, has its own 'Type'. The Flutter Structure
starts with one Widget, after that, a branch of Widgets, and so it goes in the shape of a tree.
Each Widget is a separate Class, however they are connected with each other.</p>

## Widget

<p>Two types of Widgets: Visible and not Visible. As for visible, we have Text(), Button widgets
and so on, for the not so visible we have those that make up layouts, like Row, Column, Stack...</p>
<p>Widgets describe what their view should look like given their current configuration and state,
when a widget's state changes, it rebuilds its description, and minimal changes are processed.</p>
